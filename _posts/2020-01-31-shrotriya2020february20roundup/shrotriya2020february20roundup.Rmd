## Introduction

Welcome to the February 2020 roundup! Similar to 
[last time](https://www.shamindras.com/posts/2020-01-27-shrotriya2020january20roundup/){target="_blank"}
I'm going to experiment with documenting anything interesting I come
across (articles, lectures, books, papers etc.) and any activities I get up to.
This is more for my personal benefit but may also help others.
