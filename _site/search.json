I’ve decided to start blogging to document my learning and development in statistics as a graduate student.\nI’d like it to be a fun place to document interesting things I like to read about in the statistics and machine learning space (statistical theory/methodology, research, rstats, python …) as well as anything else I am generally into e.g. books, sports etc.\nFeel free to pull up a chair, leave a comment, and join me so that we can explore together.\nMy CV can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nAcknowledgments\nI’d like to thank Salil Shrotriya for taking the profile pic.\n\n\n\n",
